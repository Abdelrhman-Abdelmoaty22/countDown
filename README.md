## Code Description

This React application provides a countdown timer with interactive controls via buttons and keyboard shortcuts. The core functionality includes starting, pausing, and resetting the timer. It also features the ability to increment and decrement hours, minutes, and seconds using both the on-screen buttons and keyboard shortcuts. When the timer reaches zero, an audio alert is played.

The application leverages React hooks such as `useState` for state management and `useEffect` for handling side effects like the timer interval and keyboard event listeners. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize functions that manage the timer state, ensuring optimal performance. The component's structure is straightforward, ensuring ease of understanding and maintenance.
